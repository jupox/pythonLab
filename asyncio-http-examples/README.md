# asyncio-http-examples

This project contains a collection of examples demonstrating how to make HTTP requests using the `aiohttp` library in Python. The examples are organized into three categories: beginner, intermediate, and expert, allowing users to progressively learn and understand different aspects of asynchronous HTTP requests.

## Examples Overview

### Beginner
- **basic_request.py**: A simple example of making a basic GET request using `aiohttp`. It defines an asynchronous function `fetch` to retrieve data from a specified URL and a `main` function to execute the request and print the response.
- **simple_post_request.py**: Demonstrates how to make a basic POST request using `aiohttp`. It defines an asynchronous function `post_data` that sends JSON data to a specified URL and prints the server's response.

### Intermediate
- **concurrent_requests.py**: Showcases how to perform multiple concurrent GET requests using `asyncio` and `aiohttp`. It defines an asynchronous function `fetch_all` that takes a list of URLs and retrieves their responses concurrently.
- **request_with_headers.py**: Illustrates how to make a GET request with custom headers using `aiohttp`. It defines an asynchronous function `fetch_with_headers` that sends a request with specified headers and prints the response.

### Expert
- **advanced_error_handling.py**: Provides an example of handling errors in HTTP requests using `aiohttp`. It defines an asynchronous function `fetch_with_error_handling` that includes try-except blocks to manage different types of exceptions during the request process.
- **streaming_response.py**: Demonstrates how to handle streaming responses with `aiohttp`. It defines an asynchronous function `fetch_streaming` that processes data as it is received from the server, allowing for efficient handling of large responses.

## Running the Examples

To run the examples, ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed. You will also need to install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`. You can do this by running:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After installing the dependencies, you can run any of the example scripts using Python. For example:

```
python examples/beginner/basic_request.py
```

## Concepts Covered

This project covers various concepts related to asynchronous programming and HTTP requests, including:
- Making GET and POST requests
- Handling concurrent requests
- Customizing request headers
- Error handling in HTTP requests
- Processing streaming responses

Feel free to explore the examples and modify them to deepen your understanding of asynchronous HTTP requests with `aiohttp`.
