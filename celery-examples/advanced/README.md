# Advanced Celery Examples

This directory contains advanced examples of using Celery with a Flask application. The examples demonstrate how to integrate Celery into a more complex application architecture, including user authentication, external API interactions, and task scheduling.

## Directory Structure

- **app.py**: This file sets up a Flask application with user authentication and multiple routes. It demonstrates how to use Celery in a full-stack application.
  
- **tasks.py**: This file defines advanced Celery tasks, including tasks that interact with external APIs and databases. It shows how to handle complex workflows with Celery.

- **celeryconfig.py**: This file contains advanced configuration settings for Celery, including result backends and task routing. It illustrates how to optimize Celery for production use.

- **worker.py**: This file is used to start the Celery worker process. It shows how to run the worker and manage task execution.

- **beat_schedule.py**: This file defines a schedule for periodic tasks using Celery Beat. It demonstrates how to set up and manage scheduled tasks.

## Getting Started

To run the advanced examples, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**: Make sure you have Flask and Celery installed. You can install them using pip:

   ```
   pip install Flask Celery
   ```

2. **Configure Celery**: Update the `celeryconfig.py` file with your broker and backend settings.

3. **Start the Flask Application**: Run the Flask application using:

   ```
   python app.py
   ```

4. **Start the Celery Worker**: In a separate terminal, start the Celery worker with:

   ```
   celery -A worker worker --loglevel=info
   ```

5. **Start Celery Beat**: If you have periodic tasks, start Celery Beat with:

   ```
   celery -A beat_schedule beat --loglevel=info
   ```

## Conclusion

These advanced examples provide a comprehensive guide to using Celery in a full-stack application. They cover various aspects of task management, including background tasks, periodic tasks, and integration with external services.
