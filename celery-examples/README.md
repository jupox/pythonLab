# Celery Examples Project

Welcome to the Celery Examples project! This repository contains a series of examples demonstrating how to use Celery with Flask, ranging from beginner to advanced levels. Each section includes a README file that provides specific instructions and explanations for the examples.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into three main directories:

- **beginner**: Contains simple examples to help you get started with Celery and Flask.
- **intermediate**: Offers more complex examples that demonstrate advanced features and configurations of Celery.
- **advanced**: Includes comprehensive examples that showcase how to integrate Celery into a full-stack application with various functionalities.

## Getting Started

To run the examples, you will need to have Python and Flask installed, along with Celery and a message broker (like RabbitMQ or Redis). Follow the instructions in each section's README file for setup and execution.

### Prerequisites
