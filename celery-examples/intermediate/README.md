# Celery Examples - Intermediate README

# Overview
This directory contains intermediate examples of using Celery with a Flask application. The examples demonstrate more advanced features of Celery, including task management, error handling, and configuration.

# Project Structure
- **app.py**: Sets up a Flask application with advanced routing and error handling.
- **tasks.py**: Contains multiple Celery tasks, showcasing different types of tasks such as background and periodic tasks.
- **celeryconfig.py**: Configuration settings for Celery, including broker settings and task serialization.

# Getting Started
To run the intermediate examples, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**: Make sure you have Flask and Celery installed. You can install them using pip:
   ```
   pip install Flask Celery
   ```

2. **Set Up the Message Broker**: Celery requires a message broker to handle task queues. You can use RabbitMQ or Redis. Make sure your broker is running.

3. **Configure Celery**: Update the `celeryconfig.py` file with your broker settings if necessary.

4. **Run the Flask Application**: Start the Flask application by running:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```

5. **Start the Celery Worker**: In a separate terminal, start the Celery worker to process tasks:
   ```
   celery -A tasks worker --loglevel=info
   ```

6. **Trigger Tasks**: You can trigger tasks through the Flask routes defined in `app.py`.

# Example Tasks
The `tasks.py` file contains examples of different types of tasks:
- **Background Tasks**: Tasks that run in the background without blocking the main application.
- **Periodic Tasks**: Tasks that are scheduled to run at regular intervals.

# Conclusion
These intermediate examples provide a deeper understanding of how to integrate Celery with Flask. Explore the code in each file to see how tasks are defined and managed, and how to handle errors and configurations effectively.
